About Dataset
Context
The Material Footprint per Capita in Tonnes dataset is a comprehensive resource assessment metric designed to examine disparities and inequalities in resource utilization within societies. This dataset offers insights into variations and imbalances experienced by individuals based on their resource consumption patterns. It serves as a complement to broader development indices, akin to the Human Development Index (HDI), by focusing on a critical dimensionâ€”resource footprint. Just as reproductive health is a key aspect of the Gender Inequality Index (GII), the Material Footprint per Capita in Tonnes dataset delves into the impact of resource distribution on development, uncovering disparities in resource consumption, and their implications for sustainable development goals.

Content
This dataset presents a comprehensive historical record of material footprint per capita in tonnes, offering insights into resource consumption trends at a global level. It encompasses key data columns, including ISO3 (the ISO3 code for each country/territory), Country (the name of the country or territory), Continent (the continent of location), Hemisphere (the hemisphere where the country is situated), as well as Material Footprint data for multiple years spanning from 1990 to 2021. These records provide a valuable resource for examining changes in resource consumption and environmental impact over time, contributing to a deeper understanding of global sustainability and resource utilization trends.
